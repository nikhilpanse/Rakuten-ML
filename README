README

Data is loaded using pandas.
Histograms, Violin plots and Heatmaps are plotted using matplotlib
ElasticNet model is used a basic model from sklearn. Cross validation score is calculated. For all estimators R2 square is used as the metric.
LightGBM model is used for better accuracy from sklearn.
Feature importances are plotted using random forest model.
From the feature importances, columns are dropped which are less significant. 
Grid Search is used for hypertuning.
Best parameters are found out and the model is trained again. Final R2 score is 0.7495
